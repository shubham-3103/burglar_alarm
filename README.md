# Burglar_Alarm
A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of computation. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs and the change from one state to another state is called transition.I have implement FSM in burglar alarm system, when IR sensor detects any motion then it will sense the temperature of the surrounding area, if the temperature is higher than the normal temperature, then alarm will be start for a particular time period and the door will be locked, if the temperature is lower than the normal temperature then nothing will happen and door will remain open and after achieving the final states it will be reseted to its initial state. If no motion is detected by the IR sensor, it will return to its initial state.
